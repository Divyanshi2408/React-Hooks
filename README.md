# useState Hook in React

The `useState` hook is one of the fundamental hooks in React that allows functional components to manage state. It is used to add state to functional components, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## Importing useState

To use the `useState` hook, you need to import it from React:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

---

## Syntax

The `useState` hook is called with an initial state value and returns an array containing two elements:

1. The **current state value**.
2. A **function to update the state**.

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

---

## Example

### Basic Counter Example

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial state is 0

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial State:**
   - `useState(0)` initializes the `count` state with the value `0`.

2. **Update State:**
   - `setCount(count + 1)` updates the state by incrementing the `count`.
   - `setCount(count - 1)` decrements the `count`.

3. **Rendering:**
   - The updated state value is automatically reflected in the component when the state changes.

## Key Points

### 1. Initial State
- The initial state can be a primitive value, an object, or an array.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const [name, setName] = useState('Divyanshi');
  ```

### 2. Updating State
- The `setState` function replaces the old state with the new state.
- For complex states (e.g., objects or arrays), update them immutably:
  ```javascript
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Divyanshi', age: 22 });

  const updateAge = () => {
    setUser({ ...user, age: 23 }); // Spread operator to retain other properties
  };
  ```

### 3. Lazy Initialization
- If the initial state requires expensive computation, use a function to compute it lazily:
  ```javascript
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    return computeExpensiveValue();
  });
  ```

### 4. State is Isolated
- Each `useState` call is independent and maintains its own state:
  ```javascript
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('React');
  ```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Direct State Mutation:**
   - Avoid modifying the state directly. Always use the `setState` function.
   - **Incorrect:**
     ```javascript
     state.value = newValue; // Do not do this
     ```
   - **Correct:**
     ```javascript
     setState(newValue);
     ```

2. **Asynchronous State Updates:**
   - State updates are asynchronous, so rely on the functional form of `setState` if the new state depends on the previous state:
     ```javascript
     setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
     ```
